#introduction
---------
ECUSTFD is a free public food image dataset. Our dataset has 19 types of food as shown in  Figure . The number of food images is 2976. The number of images and the number of objects for the same type are shown in Table. For a single food portion, we took several groups of images by using smart phones; each group of images contains a top view and a side view of this food. For each image, there is only one coin as calibration object and no more than two foods in it. If there are two food in the same image, the type of one food is different from another. We provide two datasets for researchers: one includes original images and another includes resized images. The size of each image in resized dataset is less than 1000*1000.
